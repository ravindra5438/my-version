                        <p>Castle life. The normal hustle and bustle of living the life of a princess in Castle Àlainn; as well as the regular old daily routine. Wake up, get dressed, have breakfast in the dining hall, attend to my studies; a music session, a history lesson, and a long and boring education talk with my father on the things I would need to know to rule the country as the heir, then a break for luncheon as I watch my brother practice his fighting skills. Then we have dinner and head to bed, only to wake up the next morning and repeat the whole routine again.</p>
                             
                       <p> Our parents had agreed that me and Sama were to have lessons on different topics that best suit us. While I had music, history, and an education on how to rule a country beside my brother, Sama studied warfare, courtesy, politics, diplomacy, and stewardship. Then afterward he would move on to his fighting practice with Mr. Clodwal in the courtyard. Not to long ago, I had asked Father if I could train alongside Sama, he only smiled and told me that war and battle training is the affair of men; then I had asked Mother if I could train also and she told me that I should think of more sentimental things to do such as reading, studying, or practicing music. Well, who was I to go against my parents’ bidding?</p>

                        <p>I ambled through my mother’s garden near the northwest side of the castle, running my fingers across the vines and plants as I passed by. My mother enjoyed gardening and planting as well as music and writing in her spare time; when she wasn’t busy helping father with ruling the country or trading with the Trádálik people who inhabited an island just beyond the Island of Domhan. After peace was brought to Tuer, my father insisted that trading with the Trádálik people would benefit us. He also believed having an alley would be helpful if there ever was an emergency that we could not handle ourselves. Luckily for us, an emergency such as that has not come our way. For twenty years there has been peace and unity between all Bloods, including the once despised Gray Bloods.</p>

                      <p>  I touched the delicate petals of a turquoise Black Bat Flower, wondering at the radiant blue color. It seemed to almost glow in the afternoon sunlight, sending off a soft shade of blue onto the ground below it. Beautiful, I thought, just simply and uniquely beautiful.</p>
                        
                       <p> The Black Bat Flower wasn’t the only thing that was turquoise and unique. Me and my brother both had turquoise Blood, a color that has not been seen in a Blood before. My parents are not sure why Sama and I have Turquoise Blood, though they think how we got the strange color of Blood was because my father and my mother’s Blood somehow mixed together. My mother is a White Blood and my father is a Blue Blood, and white combined with blue makes turquoise, right? But how? If Blood colors could mix, then why don’t we have more Blood colors than just five? Why would my parent’s blood mix to create turquoise? What was so special about me and Sama?</p>
                        
                        <h6>More importantly, what did fate have in store for us?</h6>
                        
                        - - -
                        
                       <p> That evening, just when the sun went down, I sat near the large glass window in my bedroom, staring up at the twinkling stars. As they glowed, they seemed to be trying to tell me something, though I wasn’t sure what. Stood up and opened the window, allowing a small breeze of chilly evening air to drift into the room. It tickled the back of my neck, sending a shiver down my spine. Moonlight poured onto the floor, lighting up the interior and casting a dancing shadow behind me. I breathed in deeply, and exhaled even slower. Nights in Castle Àlainn were the most magical that you could ever witness.</p>
                        
                      <p>  I pulled a small blanket around me even closer, listening to the soft whispering of the stars, allowing myself to be lost within the images of a time of past and future…</p>
                        
                      <p>  Peace and prosperous times…An age of shadow and death…Years when the stars would shine…A time of silver breath.</p>
                       
                        
                     <p>   Four souls, one shadow.</p>
                        
                        
                       <p>  “Blake! Look out!”</p>
                        
                       <p>  Their end, only fate will know.</p>
                        
                       <p>  “Why did fate choose me?!”</p>
                        
                       <p>  A light lost within the dark,</p>
                        
                      <p>   Veiled in the gloom,</p>
                        
                       <p>  Shattered thoughts and a blue heart,</p>
                        
                       <p>  The world of Domhan’s doom.</p>
                        
                        <p>Feelings of sadness and despair flooded me, but soon after feelings of peace and happiness soothed the burning ache, like a rainfall after years of dryness. Flashes of memories that did not belong to me filled my vision, though none of them made any sense. A single thought swirled around in my mind, was this what was to come?</p>
                        
                        
                        <p> “Want to tell me where Azure’s Heir is?”</p>
                        
                       <p> Fear. “I-I don’t know what you’re talking about…”</p>
                        
                       <p> Laughter. “Tell me where Azure’s Heir is!”</p>
                        
                       <p> “W-Who’s Azure’s Heir?”</p>
                        
                      <p>  “Don’t try to trick me with your fake innocence, girlie. I know you know where he is! If you don’t tell me in the next few seconds, you are going to die.”</p>
                        
                       <p> “S-Sir, I don’t know what you mean.”</p>
                        
                       <p> “Three.”</p>
                        
                       <p> “Sir!”</p>
                        
                      <p>  “Two.”</p>
                        
                      <p>  “Sir, please!”</p>
                        
                      <p>  “One.”</p>
                        
                       <p> One of seven doomed to die,</p>
                        
                      <p>  In unexpected hands she will lie,</p>
                        
                        <p>Connected to another soul,</p>
                        
                      <p>  Just as the prophecy foretold.</p>
                        
                       <p> I sucked in my breath as an image of the man going after a young girl, a knife in his hand. There was a shout, “NO-” and then dead silence. Though, out of nowhere, a scream broke the silence, a scream that seemed to come from above. The man seemed to almost evaporate into a shadow as he raced out of the room, just as a beautiful woman and another young girl entered the room.</p>
                        
                       <p> “No, no, no!”</p>
                        
                       <p> “...She’s gone to the Silent Woods.”</p>
                        
                       <p> “NOOOOOO!”</p>
                        
                        <p>I squeezed my eyes shut as tears trickled out of them; just as the images before me faded to black, and everything returned to normal. No more screams, no more voices whispering to me, and no more mysterious images. What could this all possibly mean?</p>
                        
                        - - -
                        
                        <p>I did not sleep well that night, my brain was too chaotic and confused wondering what I just witnessed. What had I just witnessed? It did not seem as though it was any of my memories. Nor did they seem to be Sama’s. Whose memories were they? And why did the stars show me them? I could not think straight, so I had decided to try and get some sleep. When I glanced at the clock, that’s when I noticed many hours had gone by. Crazy.</p>
                        
                        <p>The next morning, I stumbled out of bed, my head feeling like it weighed a thousand pounds. “Ugh.”</p>
                        
                        <p>Ciel, who helped me get dressed, came into my room, “Good morning, sleepy head!” She said cheerfully, “Oh my, it looks like you had a rough night.”</p>
                        
                        <p>I rubbed my face, “You have no idea.”</p>
                        
                        <p>Ciel pulled out a simple dress from my wardrobe, and helped me get into it, “Your family is taking a trip to the Bán Country to visit Her Majesty’s parents     in the Fuor Mountains later today.” She told me excitedly, “Her Majesty said I could come along! Isn’t it great? I have never been outside the Gorm Country before, so this should be fun.”</p>
                        
                      <p>  I willed my sleepy brain to wake up as I replied groggily, “Uh- That’s…great, Ciel.”</p>
                        
                       <p> Ciel put her hand on her hip, “You know what you need?”</p>
                        
                       <p> “What?”</p>
                        
                        <p> “Some of my special tea! Come on, let’s head to the kitchen and see if we can make you a cup.”</p>
